Dear Mr. Hunneker, I'm gathering material for a book relating to the first atomic bomb.

Felix Hunaker the can-can that brought me into my own particular karass was the book I never finished. God created the karass. send similar requests to them. I realize that you were a very young man when the bomb I remember I was playing in the living room carpet outside my father's study in Ilium, New York.

when I was a much younger man, My sister Angela tells me, I used to play with little toy trucks for hours making motor sounds, Chinese dentist and a British queen, all fit together in the same machine.

He said he wouldn't work on it at all unless they let him work where he wanted to work. A lot of the time that meant at home.

The only place he liked to go outside of Baconan. But Baconanism was unknown beyond the gravel beaches and coral knives that ring this little island in the Caribbean Sea, the Republic of San Lorenzo. Not because I've been unlucky for others, but because somebody or something has compelled me to be certain places at certain times I began to collect material for a book to be called one of the so-called fathers of the first atomic bomb. Dr. Hunaker himself was no doubt a member of my Since your late father is generally recognized as having been one of the chief creators of the bomb, The book to be called The Day the World Ended.

The book was to be an account of what important Americans had done on the day on the day of the bomb. And father was in his study playing with the loop of string. In his 53rd kalipso, when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. And according to plan, at each appointed second, at each appointed place, nice, I'm sick of people misunderstanding what a scientist is, what a scientist does, he said.

The general as their spokesman felt that one of the aspects of progress should be the Marines no longer had to fight in mud is this desk. Dr. Breed banged he speckled old fist on the desk.

The desk was a is only one of several types of ice. determined how each subsequent layer would stack and lock. Nothing generous about it, he said. cynical. We climbed the four granite steps before the research laboratory. Likes and dislikes have nothing to do with it, says Bekonin. His head is full of projects of his own and that's the way we want it. That old man asked me to think of United States Marines in a God-forsaken swamp. There are several ways, Dr Breed said to me, in which certain liquids can crystallize, can New knowledge is the most valuable commodity on earth.

17
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,764
What did the general have in mind? kidney-shaped, seagreen steel affair.

18
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:11,655
Suppose water always froze as ice one on earth because it had never had a seed to teach it how to form When most other companies brag about their research, they're talking about industrial It's an easy warning to forget. The bottom layer is the seat of how every cannonball or every orange that comes after is going to behave, Did anybody ever try to suggest projects to Dr. Hunaker, I said. I'll do my best to clear up the misunderstanding, I said. The more truth we have to work with, the richer we become. Their trucks and tanks and howitzers are wallowing, he complains, sinking and stinking me asthma and ooze.

19
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,090
Certainly he said, admirals and generals in particular. The absence of mud said Dr.

20
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:13,733
One marine could carry more than enough of the freeze, several ways in which their atoms can stack and lock in an orderly rigid way. The building itself was of unadorned brick and rose six stories. We passed Dr Breed made an appointment with me for early the next morning. hacked technicians who wear white coats work out of cookbooks and dream up an improved In this country he said most people don't even understand what pure research is. ice two, ice three, ice four. Had I been a baconanist then, that statement would have made me how.

21
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,968
Breed no more mud even to an infinite number of cannonballs and oranges. He would pick me up at my hotel. between two heavily armed guards at the entrance. I smiled at one of the guards.

22
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,805
Do you mean, I said to Dr. Breed that nobody in this laboratory has ever told what to work on?

23
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,331
thus simplifying my entry into the heavily guarded research laboratory.

24
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:23,101
Now suppose, Chortle Dr Breed, enjoying himself, that there were many possible ways in which water could crystallize, could freeze.

25
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:24,854
But here I asked him, here, and shockingly few other places in this country, men are paid to increased knowledge, to work to no end but that.

26
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:18,363
He did not stuff to free an armored division bogged down in the everglades. According to Felix, one marine windshield wiper or next year's Oldsmobile. He raised a finger and winked at me.

27
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:28,729
smile back. There was nothing funny about national security, nothing at all. When we got to Dr Breed's inner office started to ask Dr Breed questions about the day of the bomb.

28
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:24,333
It isn't looking for a better cigarette filter or a softer face tissue or a longer lasting house pain. God help us.

29
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,291
I remember shortly before Felix died, there was a marine general who was hounding him to do something about mud.

30
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:23,971
And suppose, and he wrapped on his desk with his old hand again, that there were one form, which we will call ice nine, They looked upon him as a sort of magician who could make America invincible with a wave of his wand. And what did Dr. Hunaker say in his playful way and all his ways were playful On his way to work, he said, I'd appreciate it if you tell me what it is. That old man with spotted hands invited me to think of the several ways in which cannonballs might be But suppose young man that one Marine had with him a tiny capsule containing a seed of Ice Nine, a new way for the atoms of water to stack and lock to freeze.

31
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,345
stacked on a courthouse lawn, or the several ways in which oranges might be packed into a crate.

32
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:29,570
Nobody even suggests what they work on? the crystal as hard as this desk with a melting point of, oh, let us say, 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or better still, a melting point of 130 degrees.

33
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,107
Breed was a pink old man, very prosperous, beautifully dressed.

34
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,653
Oh, people suggest things all the time. Mud, I said. The Marines after almost 200 years of wallowing in mud.

35
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,922
Suppose that the sort of ice we skate upon and put into high balls, If that threw that seed into the nearest puddle, the puddle, the puddle freeze, His manner was civilized, optimistic, capable, serene.

36
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,011
Everybody talks about research and practically nobody in the country is doing it.

37
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,965
And he helped me to see that the pattern of the bottom layers of the cannon balls, I said to him that's very generous of General Forge and Foundry it isn't in the nature of a pure research man to pay attention to attention to attention to attention to attention to suggest.

38
00:18:29,080 --> 00:19:40,092
the cannonballs of orange.

39
00:19:40,092 --> 00:23:08,465
in order to give you some insight into the extraordinary novelty of the ways in which Felix was isn't, I said. I just told you there wasn't, cried Dr Breed hotly.

40
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:59,454
Felix died shortly after that, and if you've the swamp froze as Ice Nine, I said. What about the rivers and the lakes?

41
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:05,423
The streams if I'd known you were a member of the Yellow Press, I wouldn't have wasted a minute with you.

I found instead a portrait of the island's dictator, Miguel Papa Munzano, He was 26 years old. The girl on the cover was enough for me, more than enough since I had fallen in love with her on sight. fed? They'd freeze, of course, he snapped. I suppose you're going to rush to market with a sensational story about Ice Nine now. I tell you, again, it does not exist. And the springs feeding the frozen lakes and streams, I said, and all the water underground feeding the springs? and that would be the end of the world and the end of the interview too. Goodbye! It was blue-white. It had a melting point of 114.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Felix Hunaker had put the happened to be alone. He did indicate, though, that his point of departure had been Cuba. They would freeze. Felix ate alone here in the cafeteria every day. His children had divided the Ice Nine among themselves. I wondered how Franklin Hunaker, who had never even finished high school, had got himself such a fancy job. You bet they would, he cried. a gorilla in his late 70s. It was a rule that no one was to sit with him to interrupt his chain of thought, but the Marine general barged in, pulled up a chair and started talking about mud. And the United States Marines would rise from the swamp and march on. She was very young and very grave too, and luminously compassionate and wise. Next to Papa's portrait was a picture of a narrow-shouldered fox-faced, immature young man. Dr Breed was mistaken about at least one thing. There was such a thing as Ice Nine, and Ice Nine was on Earth. Ice Nine was the last gift,! The luxurious pleasure craft was going down in my meaningless life with it, said the essay, all I'd eaten for four days was two biscuits and a seagull.

Maybe you'd better come to the point, I said.

61
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:07,065
When Baconin and McCabe took over this miserable country Tell me, doctor, I said to Julian Castle, how is Papa Munsono? How can you possibly know what kind of a person I am? Bekonen suggested the hook too as the proper punishment for Bekonenus, the doctor said.

62
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:07,591
Papa doesn't like the way we treat the whole patient, said Castle, Good God, I cried. What would I have to do for that?

63
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,113
We've just met, I said. How did he come to be an outlaw? I asked. There's no sense in beating around the bush, he said.

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,603
Yes, said Castle, and making great strides too, saving lives right and left.

00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:14,255
so too did the happiness of the people grow. particular the whole patient when he's dying. You? I was amazed. A bacononist too? He gazed at me levely. You too. You'll find out.

66
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,361
How would I know, he said? I had heard it said in the army that such and such a man spoke like a man with a paper rectum.

years ago, said Julian Castle, they threw out the priests, and then Baconin, cynically It was something he'd seen in the chamber of horrors at Madame Touss. It was his own idea.

He asked McCabe to outlaw him in his religion too, in order to give the religious life of the people Practically nothing, he said, and you'd drink out of gold goblets every night and eat off gold plates and have I'm a pretty good judge of character if I do say so myself. He put his hand on my shoulders again. I thought you'd probably been treating him, I said. At the house of hope and mercy in the jungle, Do people still die on the hook? I asked. I like the cut of your jib. we administer the last rights of the Bekoninous church to those who want them. Good for him, I said.

70
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:24,113
The last thing he said to me, which was about three years ago, was it the only thing that kept me off the hook was my American citizenship.!

72
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,401
Castle quoted this poem, which does not appear in the books of Bakonin.

73
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,534
We've both got things that he said. Am I to understand, I said, that you are offering me some kind of job here in San Lorenzo?

74
00:48:20,907 --> 00:48:25,011
Yes, if he keeps going at his present rate, working night and day, the number of people he die in the year He winked ghouishly. That was for zest too. We don't speak, said Castle. And I'd like the cut of your jib. It's inevitably fatal. Such a man was general Huncker. and playfully, invented a new religion.

75
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,254
And I want to talk cold turkey to you, man to He laughed. You haven't caught on yet?

Me? President, I gasped. Who else is there, he said. This is nuts, I said, said.

And he took me down to what he called his den, den, in order that we might, spade, He sighed, looking up at the evening sky, busy, busy So I said goodbye to government and I gave my reason, that a really good religion.

78
00:48:25,011 --> 00:48:29,455
I know I said, well, when it became real instrument of hope, So you said, Frank was frantic for me to complete his thought, a palace all your own? What's the job, I said? The President of the Republic of San Lorenzo. Thank you, I said. He smiled. I mean I said, does Papa really have people executed that way? Now, hoping to be hearty and persuasive, he said tenny things to me, things like, I like the cut of your jib. more zest, more tang. He wrote a little poem about it incidentally. He doesn't speak to me, that is. I think you and I could really hit it off. I gather I said that there are still several Bekoninous on the island, despite the laws, despite the hook. McCabe and Bekonen did not succeed in raising what is generally thought of is the standard of living, said Castle. The truth was that life was as short and brutish and mean as ever, but people didn't have to pay as much attention to the awful truth.!
