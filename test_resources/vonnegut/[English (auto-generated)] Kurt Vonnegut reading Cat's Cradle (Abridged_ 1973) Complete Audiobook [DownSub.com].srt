1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,399
call me jonah my parents did or nearly

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,400
did they called me john

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
jonah john if i'd been a sam i would

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,559
have been a jonas still

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,480
not because i've been unlucky for others

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,239
but because somebody or something has

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,920
compelled me to be certain places at

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
certain times without fail

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,720
conveyances and motives both

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
conventional and bizarre have been

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,680
provided

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,080
and according to plan at each appointed

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,560
second at each appointed place this

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,719
jonah was there

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,640
listen when i was a younger man two

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,559
wives ago 250 000 cigarettes ago 3 000

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,559
quarts of booze ago

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,120
when i was a much younger man i began to

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,840
collect material for a book to be called

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,320
the day the world ended

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,719
the book was to be factual

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,480
the book was to be an account of what

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,399
important americans had done on the day

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,640
when the first atomic bomb was dropped

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,320
on hiroshima japan

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
it was to be a christian book i was a

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
christian then

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,799
i am a baconist now

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,119
i would have been a baconist then if

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,280
there had been anyone to teach me the

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,000
bittersweet lies of baconen

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
but baconism was unknown beyond the

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,560
gravel beaches and coral knives that

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,479
ring this little island in the caribbean

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,759
sea

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,520
the republic of san lorenzo

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,000
we become in us believe that humanity is

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
organized into teams

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
teams that do god's will without ever

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,640
discovering what they are doing

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,680
such a team is called a crass by bakonen

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
and the instrument the can can that

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,399
brought me into my own particular crass

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,880
was the book i never finished

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,560
the book to be called

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,439
the day the world ended

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,920
if you find your life tangled up with

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,240
somebody else's life for no very logical

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
reasons writes bacon that person may be

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,000
a member of your karass

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,079
at another point in the books of bacon

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,439
he tells us

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,479
man created the checkerboard god created

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,000
the crass

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
by that he means that a crass ignores

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,280
national institutional occupational

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,000
familial and class boundaries

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
it is as free free-form as an amoeba

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,400
in his fifty-third calypso mcconan

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,030
invites us to sing along with him

61
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,760
[Music]

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,239
oh a sleeping drunkard up in central

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,239
park and a lion hunter in the jungle

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,200
dark

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,239
and a chinese dentist and a british

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,760
queen

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,519
all fit together in the same machine

68
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,400
nice

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
nice

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
very nice

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,319
nice

72
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
nice

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
very nice

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,239
nice

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,760
nice

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
very nice

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,840
so many different people in the same

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
device

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,760
about my crass then it surely includes

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
the three children of dr felix hunnicure

81
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,840
one of the so-called fathers of the

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
first atomic bomb

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
dr hunnicure himself was no doubt a

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,239
member of my crass though he was dead

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,879
before my cenucas the tendrils of my

86
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,200
life began to tangle with those of his

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
children the first of his heirs to be

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
touched by my sanukas was newton

89
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,840
hunnicure the youngest of his three

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
children the younger of his two sons i

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,040
wrote this letter to newt dear mr

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,159
hunnicutt

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
i am gathering material for a book

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
relating to the first atomic bomb

95
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,080
since your late father is generally

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,760
recognized as having been one of the

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
chief creators of the bomb

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,599
i would very much appreciate any

99
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,519
anecdotes you might care to give me of

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,120
life in your father's house on the day

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
the bomb was dropped

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,439
i'm sorry to say that i don't know as

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,599
much about your illustrious family as i

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,519
should and so don't know whether you

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,080
have brothers or sisters if you do have

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,599
brothers and sisters i would like very

107
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
much to have their addresses so that i

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,480
can send similar requests to them

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
i realize that you were a very young man

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
when the bomb was dropped which is all

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
to the good my book is going to

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
emphasize the human rather than the

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
technical side of the bomb so

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,680
recollections of the day through the

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
eyes of a baby if you pardon the

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,320
expression would fit in perfectly to

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
which newt replied

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,400
i was only six years old when they

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,040
dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima so

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,440
anything i remember about that day other

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,160
people have helped me to remember

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,840
i remember i was playing in the living

123
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,160
room carpet outside my father's study in

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
illium new york the door was open and i

125
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
could see my father he was wearing

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
pajamas in a bathrobe he was smoking a

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,440
cigar he was playing with a loop of

128
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,639
string

129
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,240
father was staying home from the

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,280
laboratory in his pajamas all day that

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,479
day he stayed home whenever he wanted to

132
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,800
father as you probably know spent

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
practically his whole professional life

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
working for the research laboratory of

135
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
the general forge and foundry company in

136
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
illium

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
when the manhattan project came along

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,800
the bomb project father wouldn't leave

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,039
illium to work on it he said he wouldn't

140
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,800
work on it at all unless they let him

141
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
work where he wanted to work a lot of

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
the time that meant at home the only

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
place he liked to go outside of illium

144
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,600
was our cottage on cape cod

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,240
cape cod was where he died he died on a

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
christmas eve you probably know that too

147
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,759
anyway i was playing on the carpet

148
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,639
outside his study on the day of the bomb

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,120
my sister angela tells me i used to play

150
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,280
with little toy trucks for hours making

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,919
motor sounds going burton burton burton

152
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,440
burton all the time

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,440
so i guess i was going burton burton

154
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
burton burton

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,639
on the day of the bomb and father was in

156
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,240
his study playing with the loop of

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,360
string

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,759
it so happens i know where the string he

159
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,000
was playing with came from maybe you can

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
use it somewhere in your book father

161
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
took the string from around the

162
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
manuscript of a novel that a man in

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
prison had sent him

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,039
novel was about the end of the world in

165
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,759
the year 2000 and the name of the book

166
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,479
was 2000 a.d

167
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,800
he told about how mad scientists made a

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
terrific bomb that wiped out the whole

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
world there was a big sex orgy when

170
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
everybody knew that the world was going

171
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,199
to end and then jesus christ himself

172
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,840
appeared 10 seconds before the bomb went

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,199
off

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,120
my father never read the book i'm pretty

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
sure i don't think he ever read a novel

176
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
or even a short story in his whole life

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,319
at least not since he was a little boy

178
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,160
he didn't read his mail or magazines and

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,479
newspapers either i suppose he read a

180
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,160
lot of technical journals but to tell

181
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,479
you the truth i can't remember my father

182
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,000
reading anything

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
as i say all he wanted from that

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,319
manuscript was a string

185
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,080
that was the way he was

186
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
nobody could predict what he was going

187
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
to be interested in next

188
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,720
on the day of the bomb it was string

189
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
have you ever read the speech he made

190
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,639
when he accepted the nobel prize this is

191
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,160
the whole speech

192
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
ladies and gentlemen i stand before you

193
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,400
now because i never stopped dawdling

194
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
like an eight-year-old on a spring

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
morning on his way to school

196
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
anything can make me stop and look and

197
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,319
wonder and sometimes learn

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,840
i'm a very happy man thank you

199
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
anyway father looked at that loop of

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,919
string for a while and then his finger

201
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,000
started playing with it his fingers made

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
the string figure called a cat's cradle

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
i don't know where father learned how to

204
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,960
do that from his father maybe

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
his father was a tailor you know so

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
there must have been thread and string

207
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,919
around all the time when father was a

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,800
boy

209
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,479
making the cat's cradle was the closest

210
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
i ever saw my father come to playing

211
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,280
what anybody else would call a game

212
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,039
he had no use at all for tricks and

213
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,560
games and rules that other people had

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,599
made up

215
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,680
in a scrapbook my sister angela used to

216
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
keep up there was a clipping from time

217
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,840
magazine when somebody asked father what

218
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
games he played for relaxation and he

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,039
said

220
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,879
why should i bother with made-up games

221
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,720
when there are so many real ones going

222
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,680
on

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
he must have surprised himself when he

224
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
made a cat's cradle out of the string

225
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
and maybe it reminded him of his own

226
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,080
childhood he all of a sudden came out of

227
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
his study and did something he'd never

228
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,039
done before he tried to play with me

229
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,199
not only had he never played with me

230
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,400
before he had hardly even spoken to me

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,319
but he went down on his hands and knees

232
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
on the carpet next to me and he showed

233
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,719
me his teeth and he waved the tangle of

234
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,640
string in my face

235
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,440
see see see he asked cat's cradle see

236
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,958
the cat's cradle see where the nice

237
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,880
 cat sleeps meow meow

238
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,600
angela was 22 then she had been the real

239
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
head of the family since she was 16

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
since mother died since i was born

241
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
she used to talk about how she had three

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,440
children me frank and father she wasn't

243
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,200
exaggerating either

244
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
i can remember cold mornings when she

245
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
frank father and i would all be in line

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,360
in the front hall

247
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
and angela would be bundling us up

248
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,760
treating us exactly the same only i was

249
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
going to kindergarten frank was going to

250
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,000
junior high school and father was going

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
to work on the atomic bomb

252
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,959
will that do is that any help to your

253
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,760
book

254
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,080
of course you really tied me down asking

255
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
me to stick to the day of the bomb there

256
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,240
are lots of other good anecdotes about

257
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
the bomb and father from other days for

258
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,399
instance do you know the story about

259
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,160
father on the day they first tested a

260
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
bomb out at alma gardo

261
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
after the thing went off after it was a

262
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
sure thing that america could wipe out a

263
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
city with just one bomb a scientist

264
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,240
turned the father and said

265
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,480
science has now known sin

266
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,440
do you know what the father said he said

267
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
what is sin

268
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,720
all the best

269
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,399
newton hunnaker

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,760
ps you call our family illustrious and i

271
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,120
think you would maybe be making a

272
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
mistake if you called it that in your

273
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,000
book

274
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,240
i am a for instance four feet

275
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,040
tall

276
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,480
and the last we heard of my brother

277
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
frank he was wanted by the florida

278
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
police the fbi and the treasury

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,079
department for running stolen cars to

280
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
cuba on war surplus lsts

281
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,959
so i'm pretty sure illustrious isn't

282
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,800
quite the word you're after

283
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,560
glamorous is probably closer to the

284
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,240
truth

285
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
pps

286
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,640
24 hours later i have re-read this

287
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,560
letter and i can see where somebody

288
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
might get the impression that i don't do

289
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,959
anything but sit around and remember sad

290
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,839
things and pity myself actually i'm a

291
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,160
very lucky person and i know it i'm

292
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,640
about to marry a wonderful little girl

293
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
there is love enough in this world for

294
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,200
everybody if people will just look i am

295
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,760
proof of this

296
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,839
newt did not tell me who his girlfriend

297
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,200
was

298
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
but about two weeks after he wrote to me

299
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
everybody in the country knew that her

300
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
name was zinka plain zinka apparently

301
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
she didn't have a last name

302
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
zinka was a ukrainian a dancer

303
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,560
with a borzoic dance company

304
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
as it happened newt saw a performance by

305
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,120
that company in indianapolis

306
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
when the performance was over little

307
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
newt was outside the stage door with a

308
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,839
dozen long stemmed american beauty roses

309
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
the newspapers picked up the story when

310
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,839
little zinka asked for political asylum

311
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,160
in the united states and then she and

312
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
little newt disappeared

313
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,920
one week after that little zinka

314
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
presented herself at the russian embassy

315
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,760
she said americans were too

316
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
materialistic she said she wanted to go

317
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
home

318
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
i loafed on my book about the day of the

319
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,160
bomb about a year later two days before

320
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
christmas another story carried me

321
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,480
through illium new york where dr felix

322
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,560
hunnicure had done most of his work

323
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,399
where little newt frank and angela had

324
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,560
spent their formative years

325
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
made an appointment with dr asa breed

326
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,560
vice president in charge of the research

327
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
laboratory of the general forge and

328
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
foundry company

329
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,399
i suppose dr breed was a member of mike

330
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,639
harass too though he took a dislike to

331
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,440
me almost immediately likes and dislikes

332
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,519
have nothing to do with it says baconen

333
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,040
it's an easy warning to forget

334
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,519
dr breed made an appointment with me for

335
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
early the next morning he would pick me

336
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
up at my hotel on his way to work he

337
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,399
said thus simplifying my entry into the

338
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,320
heavily guarded research laboratory

339
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
breed was a pink old man very prosperous

340
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,399
beautifully dressed

341
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
his manner was civilized optimistic

342
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,600
capable serene i by contrast felt

343
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
bristly diseased cynical

344
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
we climbed the four granite steps before

345
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,279
the research laboratory the building

346
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,760
itself was of unadorned brick and rose

347
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,920
six stories we passed between two

348
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,320
heavily armed guards at the entrance i

349
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,160
smiled at one of the guards he did not

350
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,519
smile back

351
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,440
there was nothing funny about national

352
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,800
security nothing at all

353
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,519
when we got to dr breed's inner office i

354
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,600
started to ask dr breed questions about

355
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
the day of the bomb

356
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,760
i'm sick of people misunderstanding what

357
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,920
a scientist is what a scientist does he

358
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,959
said

359
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,399
i'll do my best to clear up the

360
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,639
misunderstanding i said

361
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,480
in this country said most people don't

362
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,519
even understand what pure research is

363
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
i'd appreciate it if you tell me what it

364
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
is

365
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
it isn't looking for a better cigarette

366
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,839
filter or softer face tissue or a longer

367
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,959
lasting house pain god help us

368
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
everybody talks about research and

369
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,399
practically nobody in the country is

370
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,399
doing it we're one of the few companies

371
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,320
that actually hires men to do pure

372
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,600
research

373
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
when most other companies brag about

374
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,720
their research they're talking about

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,880
industrial hack technicians who wear

376
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
white coats work out of cookbooks and

377
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,199
dream up an improved windshield wiper or

378
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,360
next year's oldsmobile

379
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,839
but here i asked

380
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,160
him here in shockingly few other places

381
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
in this country men are paid to increase

382
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,079
knowledge to work to no end but that

383
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
i said to him that's very generous of

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,240
general forge and foundry company

385
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
nothing generous about it he said new

386
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
knowledge is the most valuable commodity

387
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
on earth the more truth we have to work

388
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,360
with the richer we become

389
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
had i been a baconist then that

390
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,720
statement would have made me howl

391
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,639
do you mean i said to dr bree that

392
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
nobody in this laboratory is ever told

393
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,600
what to work on nobody even suggests

394
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,519
what they work on

395
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,079
oh people suggest things all the time

396
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,760
but it isn't in the nature of a pure

397
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
research man to pay any attention to

398
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
suggestions his head is full of projects

399
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,639
of his own and that's the way we want it

400
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,959
did anybody ever try to suggest projects

401
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,360
to dr hunnicker i said

402
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,279
certainly he said admirals and generals

403
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,440
in particular they looked upon him as a

404
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
sort of magician who could make america

405
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
invincible with a wave of his wand i

406
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
remember shortly before felix died there

407
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
was a marine general who was hounding

408
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
him to do something about mud

409
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
mud i said the marines after almost 200

410
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,560
years of wallowing in mud were sick of

411
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,040
it said dr breed the general as their

412
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
spokesman felt that one of the aspects

413
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,959
of progress should be that marines no

414
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,880
longer had to fight in mud

415
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
what did the general have in mind

416
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,160
the absence of mud said dr breed no more

417
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,120
mud

418
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,519
and what did dr hunnicure say

419
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,079
in his playful way and all his ways were

420
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,639
playful felix suggested that there might

421
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
be a single grain of something even a

422
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,480
microscopic grain that could make

423
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,199
infinite expanses of muck marsh swamp

424
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
creeks pools quicksand and mire as solid

425
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,240
as this desk

426
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,720
dr breed banged the speckled old fist on

427
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,199
the desk the desk was a kidney-shaped

428
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,680
sea green steel affair

429
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,519
one marine could carry more than enough

430
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,040
of this stuff to free an armored

431
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,440
division bogged down in the everglades

432
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,519
according to felix one marine could

433
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,360
carry enough of the stuff to do that

434
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,759
under the nail of his little finger

435
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,720
that's impossible i said he was able to

436
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,800
explain it to me said dr breed and i'm

437
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,399
sure that i can explain it to you

438
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
there are several ways dr breed said to

439
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
me in which certain liquids can

440
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,759
crystallize can freeze

441
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,680
several ways in which their atoms can

442
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,639
stack

443
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,759
and lock in an orderly rigid way

444
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
that old man with spotted hands invited

445
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,839
me to think of the several ways in which

446
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
cannonballs might be stacked on a

447
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
courthouse lawn of the several ways in

448
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,839
which oranges might be packed into a

449
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,519
crate

450
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,360
and it helped me to see that the pattern

451
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
of the bottom layers of the cannonballs

452
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,600
or of oranges determined how each

453
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
subsequent layer would stack and lock

454
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
the bottom layer is the seed of how

455
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
every cannonball or every orange it

456
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,720
comes after is going to behave

457
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,399
even to an infinite number of

458
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,120
cannonballs and oranges

459
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,680
now suppose turtle dr breed enjoying

460
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,079
himself that there were many possible

461
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,320
ways in which water could crystallize

462
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,160
could freeze

463
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
suppose that the sort of ice we skate

464
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,320
upon and put into high balls what we

465
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
might call ice one

466
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,639
is only one of several types of ice

467
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,760
suppose water always froze as ice won on

468
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,839
earth because it had never had a seed to

469
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,640
teach it how to form ice two ice three

470
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,160
ice four

471
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,640
and suppose and he wrapped on his desk

472
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,319
with his old hand again

473
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,640
that there were one form which we will

474
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,039
call ice nine the crystal as hard as

475
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,679
this desk with a melting point of oh let

476
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,119
us say 100 degrees fahrenheit or better

477
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,360
still a melting point of 130 degrees

478
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
that old man asked me to think of united

479
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
states marines in a god-forsaken swamp

480
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,000
their trucks and tanks and houses are

481
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
wallowing he complains sinking and

482
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
stinking me asthma and ooze

483
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,080
he raised a finger and winked at me but

484
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
supposed young man that one marine had

485
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,400
with him a tiny capsule containing a

486
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,480
seed of ice nine

487
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,400
a new way for the atoms of water to

488
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
stack and lock to freeze

489
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
if that marine threw that seed into the

490
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,840
nearest puddle

491
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,640
the puddle would freeze i guess and all

492
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,720
the muck around the puddle he said it

493
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
would freeze

494
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
and all the puddles in the frozen muck

495
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,280
he said

496
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,039
they would freeze

497
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,960
and the pools and streams in the frozen

498
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
monkey said

499
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,679
they would freeze

500
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,160
you bet they would he cried and the

501
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,240
united states marines would rise from

502
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,520
the swamp and march on

503
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,880
there is such stuff i asked

504
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,520
no no no said dr breed losing patience

505
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,919
with me again i only told you all this

506
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,760
in order to give you some insight into

507
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,000
the extraordinary novelty of the ways in

508
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,919
which felix was likely to approach an

509
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,360
old problem

510
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
what i've just told you is what he told

511
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
a marine general who was hounding him

512
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,400
about mud

513
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
felix ate alone here in the cafeteria

514
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,679
every day

515
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,360
it was a rule that no one was to sit

516
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,960
with him to interrupt his chain of

517
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,520
thought but the marine general barged in

518
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
pulled up a chair and started talking

519
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
about mud

520
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,720
what i've told you was felix's offhand

521
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,640
reply

522
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
there there really isn't such a thing i

523
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,919
said

524
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,919
i just told you there wasn't quite dr

525
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,799
breed hotly felix died shortly after

526
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,799
that and if you'd been listening to what

527
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,640
i've been trying to tell you about pure

528
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
research men you wouldn't ask such a

529
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,840
question

530
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,679
pure research men work on what

531
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,160
fascinates them not on what fascinates

532
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
other people

533
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,559
i keep thinking about that swamp i said

534
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,960
well you can stop thinking about it i've

535
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,559
made the only point i wanted to make

536
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,400
with that swamp

537
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
if the streams flowing through the swamp

538
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,039
froze is ice 9 i said what about the

539
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,600
rivers and the lakes the streams fed

540
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,360
they'd freeze but there is no such thing

541
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,039
as ice nine

542
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,919
and the oceans the frozen rivers fed

543
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,160
they'd freeze of course he snapped i

544
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,600
suppose you're going to rush to market

545
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,480
with a sensational story about ice 9 now

546
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
i tell you again it does not exist

547
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,919
and the springs feeding the frozen lakes

548
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,000
and streams i said and all the water

549
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
underground feeding the springs they'd

550
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,720
freeze damn it he cried but if i'd known

551
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,440
you were a member of the yellow press

552
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,679
i wouldn't have wasted a minute with you

553
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,840
and the rain i said

554
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,520
when it fell it would freeze into hard

555
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
little hobnails of ice nine and that

556
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
would be the end of the world in the end

557
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,480
of the interview too goodbye

558
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,440
dr breed was mistaken about at least one

559
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
thing

560
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,280
there was such a thing as ice 9

561
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,840
and ice 9 was on earth

562
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,640
ice 9 was the last gift felix hunnicure

563
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,039
created for mankind before going to his

564
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
just reward

565
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,559
he did it without anyone's realizing

566
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,000
what he was doing

567
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,679
he did it without leaving records of

568
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,120
what he had done

569
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,240
he had made a chip of ice 9 it was blue

570
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,600
white it had a melting point of

571
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,440
114.4 degrees fahrenheit

572
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
felix hunnicure had put the chip in a

573
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,679
little bottle and he put the bottle in

574
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,960
his pocket

575
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,039
and he had gone to his cottage on cape

576
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,280
cod with his three children they're

577
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,919
intending to celebrate christmas

578
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,760
angela had been 34. frank had been 24.

579
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,880
little nude had been 18. the old man had

580
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,679
died on christmas eve having told only

581
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,799
his children about ice 9.

582
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
his children had divided the ice 9 among

583
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,840
themselves

584
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,120
and then one day one sunday i found out

585
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,600
where the fugitive from justice was

586
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,679
where franklin hunnicutt could be found

587
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,520
he was alive

588
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
the news was in a special supplement to

589
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,600
the new york sunday times the supplement

590
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,400
was a paid ad for a banana republic on

591
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,159
its cover was a profile of the most

592
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,000
heartbreakingly beautiful girl i ever

593
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
hoped to see

594
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,919
beyond the girl bulldozers were knocking

595
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,039
down palm trees making a broad avenue at

596
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,799
the end of the avenue were the steel

597
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,679
skeletons of three new buildings

598
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,760
the republic of san lorenzo said the

599
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,720
copy on the cover on the move a healthy

600
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,559
happy progressive freedom-loving

601
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,120
beautiful nation makes itself extremely

602
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,039
attractive to american investors and

603
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,360
tourists alike

604
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,240
i was in no hurry to read the contents

605
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
the girl on the cover was enough for me

606
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
more than enough since i had fallen in

607
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,320
love with her on site

608
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,120
she was very young and very grave too

609
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,400
and luminously compassionate and wise

610
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
she was as brown as chocolate her hair

611
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
was like golden flax her name was mona

612
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,559
almonds manzano the cover said

613
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,159
she was the adopted daughter of the

614
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,559
dictator of the island i opened the

615
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,400
supplement hoping for more pictures of

616
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,120
this sublime mongrel madonna

617
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,960
i found instead a portrait of the

618
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,080
island's dictator miguel papa manzano a

619
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
gorilla in his late 70s

620
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,559
next to papa's portrait was a picture of

621
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,360
a narrow shouldered fox-faced immature

622
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,480
young man

623
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
he wore a snow white military blouse

624
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,159
with some sort of jeweled sunburst

625
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,320
hanging on it his eyes were closed

626
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,559
together they had circles under them

627
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,120
this unattractive child was identified

628
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,840
as major general franklin hunnicure

629
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
minister of science and progress in the

630
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,080
republic of san lorenzo

631
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,360
he was 26 years old

632
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,120
i wondered how franklin hunnicutt who

633
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,360
had never even finished high school had

634
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,080
got himself such a fancy job

635
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,320
i found a partial answer in a florida

636
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,960
essay titled what san lorenzo has meant

637
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,280
to one american it was almost certainly

638
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,640
ghost written

639
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,799
it was signed by major general franklin

640
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,080
hunnicure

641
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,400
in the essay frank told of being all

642
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,120
alone on a nearly swamped 68-foot chris

643
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,039
craft on the caribbean

644
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,960
he didn't explain what he was doing on

645
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
it or how he happened to be alone it did

646
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
indicate though that his point of

647
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
departure had been cuba

648
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
the luxurious pleasure craft was going

649
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,320
down in my meaningless life with it said

650
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
the essay all i'd eaten for four days

651
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,120
was two biscuits and a seagull

652
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,039
the dorsal fins of man-eating sharks

653
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,039
were cleaving the warm seas all around

654
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,279
me and needle teeth barracuda were

655
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,840
making those waters boil

656
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,159
i raised my eyes to my maker willing to

657
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
accept whatever his decision might be

658
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,880
and my eyes are lit on a glorious

659
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,600
mountain peak above the clouds

660
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
what frank saw from his sinking pleasure

661
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,480
craft

662
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
was the peak of mount mccabe

663
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,720
gentle seas then nuzzled frank's

664
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,480
pleasure craft to the rocky shores of

665
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,039
san lorenzo as though god wanted him to

666
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,720
go there

667
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,360
frank stepped ashore dry shot and asked

668
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,640
where he was

669
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,200
the essay didn't say so but the son of a

670
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,279
 had a piece of ice 9 with him in a

671
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,360
thermos jug

672
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,760
frank having no passport was put in jail

673
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,240
in the capital city of bolivar he was

674
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,880
visited there by papa manzano who wanted

675
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,960
to know if it was possible that frank

676
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,200
was a blood relative of the immortal dr

677
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,120
felix hunica

678
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,000
i admitted i was said frank in the essay

679
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,080
since that moment every door to

680
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
opportunity in san lorenzo has been

681
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,799
opened to me

682
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,159
as it happened

683
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,000
as it was supposed to happen but conan

684
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,480
would say i was assigned by a magazine

685
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,360
to do a story in san lorenzo the story

686
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,480
wasn't to be about papa manzano or frank

687
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,799
it was to be about julian castle an

688
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,960
american sugar millionaire who had at

689
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,679
the age of 40 followed the example of dr

690
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,840
albert schweitzer by founding a free

691
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,080
hospital in a jungle by devoting his

692
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,200
life to miserable folk of another race

693
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,279
castle's hospital was called the house

694
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,120
of hope and mercy in the jungle

695
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
i flew to san lorenzo the seating on the

696
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,600
airplane bound ultimately for san

697
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,640
lorenzo from miami was three and three

698
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
there was a small saloon in the rear of

699
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,159
the plane and i repaired there for a

700
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,360
drink

701
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,039
it was there i met another fellow

702
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,840
american h lo crosby of evanston

703
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
illinois and his wife hazel

704
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,799
they were heavy people in their 50s they

705
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,600
spoke twangingly crosby told me that he

706
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
owned a bicycle factory in chicago that

707
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
he had had nothing but ingratitude from

708
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
his employees he was going to move his

709
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,880
business to grateful san lorenzo

710
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,520
you know san lorenzo well i asked

711
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,039
this will be the first time i've ever

712
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,640
seen it but everything i've heard about

713
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,600
it i like said h lo crosby they've got

714
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,720
discipline

715
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,480
they've got something you can count on

716
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,400
from one year to the next they don't

717
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,840
have the government encouraging

718
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,080
everybody to be some kind of original

719
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,720
piss ant nobody ever heard of before

720
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,080
sir

721
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
christ back in chicago we don't make

722
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,240
bicycles anymore he said

723
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,080
it's all human relations now the

724
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,919
eggheads sit around trying to figure out

725
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,080
new ways for everybody to be happy

726
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
nobody can get fired no matter what and

727
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
if somebody does accidentally make a

728
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,559
bicycle the union accuses us of cruel

729
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,480
and inhuman practices and the government

730
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,960
confiscates a bicycle for back taxes and

731
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,400
gives it to a blind man in afghanistan

732
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,919
and you think things will be better and

733
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,559
san lorenzo asked him i know damn well

734
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,320
they will be the people down there are

735
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,840
poor enough and scared enough and

736
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,440
ignorant enough to have some common

737
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,200
sense

738
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,120
crosby asked me what my name was and

739
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,520
what my business was i told him and his

740
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,440
wife hazel recognized my name as an

741
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,799

hoosier i'm not i said i never knew

747
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,840
anybody who was

748
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,159
hoosiers do all right she said

749
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,600
lo and i have been around the world

750
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
twice and everywhere we went we found

751
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,840
hoosiers in charge of everything that's

752
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,360
reassuring

753
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,279
you know the manager of the new hotel in

754
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,720
istanbul she said no he's a hoosier and

755
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,600
the military whatever it is in tokyo

756
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,159
attache said her husband he's a hoosier

757
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,480
said hazel

758
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,799
she grasped me firmly by the arm we

759
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,360
hoosiers got to stick together right i

760
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,720
said you call me mom what whenever i

761
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
meet a young hoosier i tell them you

762
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,559
call me mom

763
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,320
uh-huh i said

764
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,399
let me hear you say it church mom

765
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,320
hazel's obsession with hoosiers around

766
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
the world was a textbook example of a

767
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,880
false crise of a seeming team that was

768
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,960
meaningless in terms of the way god gets

769
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,240
things done

770
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,480
a textbook example of what bocconin

771
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
calls a grand faloon

772
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,559
other examples of grand faloons are the

773
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,240
communist party the daughters of the

774
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,480
american revolution the general electric

775
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,640
company the international order of odd

776
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,200
fellows and any nation anytime anywhere

777
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,279
h lo crosby was of the opinion that

778
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,960
dictatorships were often very good

779
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
things he wasn't a terrible person and

780
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,279
he wasn't a fool it suited him to

781
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,799
confront the world with a certain

782
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
barnyard clownishness

783
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,720
but many of the things he had to say

784
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
about undisciplined mankind were not

785
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,120
only funny but true

786
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
they just don't have any crime down

787
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,559
there he told me

788
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,640
papa manzano's made crime so damn

789
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,720
unattractive nobody even thinks about it

790
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,399
without getting sick

791
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
erd you can lay a billfold in the middle

792
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,159
of a sidewalk and you can come back a

793
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,240
week later and it'll be right there with

794
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,840
everything still in it

795
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,360
uh-huh i said

796
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
you know what the punishment is for

797
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,799
stealing something no

798
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,520
the hook he said no fines no probation

799
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,000
no 30 days in jail it's a hook

800
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
the hook for stealing for murder for

801
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,159
arson for treason for rape for being a

802
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,520
peeping tom

803
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,679
break a law any damn law at all and it's

804
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,640
the hook

805
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,559
everybody can understand that and san

806
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,559
lorenzo is the best behaved country in

807
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,840
the world

808
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,159
what is the hook i asked him

809
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,200
they put up a gallo see two posts in the

810
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,360
beam and then they take a great big kind

811
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,200
of iron fish hook and they hang it down

812
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
from the crossbeam then they take

813
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
somebody who's dumb enough to break the

814
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,559
law and they put the point of the

815
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,320
hooking through one side of his belly

816
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,919
and out the other and then they let him

817
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,320
go and there he hangs by god one damn

818
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,720
sorry lawbreaker

819
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,880
good god i said

820
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,200
i don't say it's good said crosby but i

821
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,039
don't say it's bad either i sometimes

822
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,480
wonder if something like that wouldn't

823
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,720
clear up juvenile delinquency

824
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
maybe the hook's a little extreme for a

825
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,520
democracy public hangings more like it

826
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,760
string up a few teenage car thieves on a

827
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,600
lamppost in front of their houses with

828
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
signs around their necks saying mama

829
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,279
here's your boy

830
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,279
do that a few times and i think ignition

831
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,039
locks would go the way the rumble seat

832
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,360
and running boards

833
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,120
we saw that thing in the basement of the

834
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,159
waxworks in london said hazel what thing

835
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,640
i asked her the hook down in the chamber

836
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,720
of horrors in the basement they had a

837
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
wax person hanging up from a hook and

838
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,480
made them two sews

839
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,399
it looked so real i wanted to throw up

840
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,720
as it happened as it was supposed to

841
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,679
happen my seat mates were horlick minton

842
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,520
the new american ambassador to the

843
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,000
republic of san lorenzo and his wife

844
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,919
claire

845
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,679
they were reading a fat typewritten

846
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,440
manuscript that was spread across the

847
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,000
chair arm between them

848
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,559
when i again took my seat minton handed

849
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,559
me the manuscript he and his wife had

850
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,640
been reading

851
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,440
the name of the book was san lorenzo the

852
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,799
land the history the people

853
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,720
the author was philip castle the son of

854
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,960
julian castle the son of the great

855
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,679
altruist i was on my way to sea

856
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,159
i let the book fall open where it would

857
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,919
as it happened it fell open to the

858
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,080
chapter about the island's outlawed holy

859
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
man baconen

860
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,679
there was a quotation from the books of

861
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,320
bacona and on the page before me those

862
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,399
words leaped out from the page and into

863
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,279
my mind and they were welcomed there

864
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,880
the words were paraphrased of the

865
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,679
suggestion by jesus render therefore

866
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,200
unto caesar the things which are

867
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,880
caesar's the conan's paraphrase was this

868
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,440
paying no attention to caesar caesar

869
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,279
doesn't have the slightest idea what's

870
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,919
really going on

871
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:05,710
[Music]

872
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,799
so

873
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,279
[Music]

874
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,880
bakonen i learned from castle's book was

875
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,600
born in 1891 he was a negro born an

876
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,760
episcopalian and a british subject on

877
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,840
the island of tobago

878
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,519
he was christened lionel boyd johnson

879
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,440
lionel boyd johnson was intellectually

880
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,320
ambitious enough in 1911 to sail alone

881
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,559
from tobago to london in a sloot named

882
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,480
the lady slipper

883
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,919
his purpose was to gain a higher

884
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,519
education

885
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,960
he enrolled in the london school of

886
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,679
economics and political science

887
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,440
his education was interrupted by the

888
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,200
first world war

889
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,120
enlisted in the infantry fought with

890
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
distinction was commissioned in the

891
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,080
field

892
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,039
was mentioned four times in dispatches

893
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,720
he was gassed in the second battle of

894
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,760
wipers

895
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,000
was hospitalized for two years and then

896
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,679
discharged

897
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,480
then he set sail for home for tobago

898
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,679
alone in the lady slipper again

899
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,240
in 1922 he sought shelter from a

900
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,200
hurricane in puerto prance haiti which

901
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,360
country was then occupied by united

902
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,519
states marines

903
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,120
johnson was approached there by a

904
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,360
brilliant self-educated idealistic

905
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,320
marine deserter named earl mccabe mccabe

906
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,799
was a corporal he had just stolen his

907
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,440
company's recreation fund he offered

908
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,440
johnson 500 for transportation to miami

909
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,080
the two set sail from miami but a gale

910
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,919
hounded the schooner onto the rocks of

911
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,559
san lorenzo the boat went down

912
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,200
johnson and mccabe absolutely naked

913
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,600
managed to swim ashore

914
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,679
how he came by the name of bakonen was

915
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,679
very simple mcconan was the

916
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,159
pronunciation given the name johnson in

917
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,960
the island's english dialect

918
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,120
my reading of the life of baconan was

919
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,720
interrupted by h lo crosby's wife hazel

920
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,519
she was standing in the aisle next to me

921
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,679
you'll never believe it she said

922
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,918
but i just found two more hoosiers on

923
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,520
this airplane i'll be damned i said

924
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
her name is connors and his name is

925
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,960
hunnicure

926
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,879
so i went aft to talk to angela

927
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,800
hunnicker connors and little newton

928
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,520
hunnicutt members of my caraz

929
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,918
angela was a horse-faced platinum blonde

930
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,839
i had noticed earlier

931
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,480
newt was a very tiny young man indeed

932

1117
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,079
jungle

1118
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,240
tell me doctor i said to julian castle

1119

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,640
how would i know he said

1121
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,000
i thought you'd probably been treating

1122
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,920
him i said

1123
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,520
we don't speak said castle he smiled

1124
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,680
he doesn't speak to me that is the last

1125
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,280
thing he said to me which was about

1126
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
three years ago was that the only thing

1127
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,880
that kept me off the hook was my

1128
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,119
american citizenship

1129
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,040
what have you done to offend him so i

1130
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,160
said

1131
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,680
you come down here and with your own

1132
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,440
money found a free hospital for these

1133
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,880
people

1134
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,640
papa doesn't like the way we treat the

1135
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,880
whole patient said castle particularly

1136
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,119
the whole patient when he's dying at the

1137
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,280
house of hope and mercy in the jungle we

1138
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,800
administer the last rites of the

1139
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,000
baconanus church to those who want them

1140
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,760
i gather i said that there are still

1141
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,240
several baconess on the island despite

1142
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,119
the laws despite the hook

1143
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,680
he laughed you haven't caught on yet

1144
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,359
to what i said

1145
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,000
everybody in san lorenzo is a devout

1146
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,319
baconanist the hook notwithstanding

1147
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,560
when bokkonen and mccabe took over this

1148
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,960
miserable country years ago said julian

1149
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,280
castle they threw out the priests and

1150
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,680
then becoming cynically and playfully

1151
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,800
invented a new religion i know i said

1152
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,560
well when it became evident that no

1153
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,640
governmental or economic reform was

1154
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,079
going to make the people much less

1155
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,240
miserable the religion became the one

1156
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,880
real instrument of hope truth was the

1157
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,560
enemy of the people because the truth

1158
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,119
was so terrible so the conan made it his

1159
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,960
business to provide the people with

1160
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,280
better and better lies

1161
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,000
how did he come to be an outlaw i asked

1162
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,720
it was his own idea he asked mccabe to

1163
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,200
outlaw him and his religion too in order

1164
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,960
to give the religious life of the people

1165
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
more zest more tang

1166
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,400
he wrote a little poem about it

1167
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,079
incidentally

1168
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,400
castle quoted this poem which does not

1169
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,960
appear in the books of bocconan

1170
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,800
so i said goodbye to government and i

1171
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,960
gave my reason that a really good

1172
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,000
religion

1173
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,319
is a form of treason

1174
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,240
but conan suggested the hook too as the

1175
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,160
proper punishment for becoming us the

1176
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,440
doctor said

1177
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,880
it was something he'd seen in the

1178
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,920
chamber of horrors at madame tussauds

1179
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,480
he went ghoulishly that was possessed

1180
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,079
too

1181
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,400
mccabe and conan did not succeed in

1182
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,079
raising what is generally thought of as

1183
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,480
the standard of living said castle the

1184
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,560
truth was that life was as short and

1185
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,800
brutish and mean as ever but people

1186
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,640
didn't have to pay as much attention to

1187
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,160
the awful truth

1188
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,240
as a living legend of the cruel tyrant

1189
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,640
in the city and the gentle holy man in

1190
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,359
the jungle grew so too did the happiness

1191
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,280
of the people grow

1192
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,079
do people still die on the hook i asked

1193
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,240
it's inevitably fatal

1194
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,160
i mean i said does papa really have

1195
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,720
people executed that way

1196
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,200
he executes one every two years just to

1197
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,280
keep the pot boiling so to speak said

1198
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,720
the doctor

1199
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
he sighed looking up at the evening sky

1200
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,760
busy busy busy

1201
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,040
sir i said

1202
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,359
it's what we become in a say he said

1203
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,040
when we feel that a lot of mysterious

1204
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,640
things are going on

1205
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,720
you i was amazed a bacon in this two

1206
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,520
he gazed at me lovely you too you'll

1207
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,680
find out

1208
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,760
if you aren't papa's doctor i said who

1209
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,200
is

1210
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,440
one of my staff a doctor schlichter von

1211
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,800
koenig's fault

1212
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,560
a german i said

1213
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,680
vaguely

1214
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,400
he was in the ss for 14 years he was a

1215
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,400
camp physician at auschwitz for six of

1216
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,200
those years he's doing penance at the

1217
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,160
house of hope and mercy is he now

1218
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
yes said castle and making great strides

1219
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,280
too saving lives right and left

1220
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,440
good for him i said

1221
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,480
yes

1222
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,240
if he keeps going at his present rate

1223
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,160
working night and day the number of

1224
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,760
people he has saved will equal the

1225
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
number of people he let die

1226
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,480
in the year three thousand and ten

1227
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,720
so there's another member of my karass

1228
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,319
dr schlichter von koenigsbald

1229
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,240
about this franklin hunnicutt the

1230
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,319
pinch-faced child spoke with the timber

1231
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,400
and conviction of a kazoo

1232
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,160
i had heard it said in the army that

1233
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
such and such a man spoke like a man

1234
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,079
with a paper rectum

1235
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,640
such a man was general hunnicure

1236
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,200
now hoping to be hearty and persuasive

1237
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,440
he said tiny things to me things like i

1238
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,680
like the cut of your jib and i want to

1239
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,240
talk cold turkey to you man to man

1240
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,760
and he took me down to what he called

1241
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,400
his den in order that we might

1242
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,560
call a spade a spade and let the chips

1243
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,640
fall where they may

1244
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,319
maybe you'd better come to the point i

1245
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,760
said

1246
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,359
there's no sense in beating around the

1247
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,520
bush he said i'm a pretty good judge of

1248
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,240
character if i do say so myself and i

1249
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
like the cut of your jib

1250
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
thank you i said i think you and i could

1251
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,240
really hit it off

1252
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,640
i have no doubt of it i said

1253
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,520
we've both got things that mash he said

1254
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,599
you're a worldly person used to meeting

1255
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,079
the public and i'm a technical person

1256
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,920
used to working behind the scenes making

1257
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,000
things go

1258
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,839
how can you possibly know what kind of a

1259
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,560
person i am we've just met i said

1260
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,720
your clothes he said the way you talk he

1261
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,040
put his hand on my shoulders again i

1262
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,960
like the cut of your jib

1263
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,560
so you said

1264
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
frank was frantic for me to complete his

1265
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,040
thought to do it enthusiastically but i

1266
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,559
was still at sea

1267
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,359
am i to understand i said that you are

1268
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,920
offering me some kind of job here in san

1269
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,200
lorenzo

1270
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,599
he clapped his hands he was delighted

1271
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,960
that's right

1272
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,480
what would you say to a hundred thousand

1273
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,319
dollars a year

1274
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,960
good god i cried what would i have to do

1275
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,079
for that practically nothing he said and

1276
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,920
you'd drink out of gold goblets every

1277
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,839
night and eat off gold plates and have a

1278
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,160
palace all your own

1279
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,280
what's the job i said

1280
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,440
the president of the republic of san

1281
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,200
lorenzo

1282
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,160
me president i asked

1283
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,319
who else is there he said

1284
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,880
this is nuts i said

1285
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,800
don't say no until you've really thought

1286
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,359
about it frank watched me anxiously

1287
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,040
no i said

1288
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,119
you haven't really thought about it

1289
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,720
i thought about it enough to know it's

1290
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,480
crazy i said

1291
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,319
we'd work together said frank i'd be

1292
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,480
backing you all the time

1293
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,400
good i said so if i got plugged from the

1294
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,559
front you'd get it too

1295
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,079
plugged he said

1296
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,000
shot assassinated

1297
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,319
frank was mystified why would anybody

1298
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,520
shoot you

1299
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,920
so he could get to be president i said

1300
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,400
frank shook his head nobody in san

1301
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,640
lorenzo wants to be president

1302
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,119
it's against their religion

1303
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,040
it's against your religion too i said i

1304
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,480
thought you were going to be the next

1305
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,680
president

1306
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,800
i

1307
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,880
he found it hard to go on he looked

1308
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,520
haunted you what i said

1309
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,839
maturity the way i understand it he told

1310
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,200
me is knowing what your limitations are

1311
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,280
he wasn't far from becoming in defining

1312
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,319
maturity maturity but conan tells us is

1313
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,160
a bitter disappointment for which no

1314
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,839
remedy exists

1315
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,920
unless laughter can be said to remedy

1316
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,680
anything

1317
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,440
frank said to me

1318
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,319
come on be president of san lorenzo

1319
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,240
you'd be real good at it with your

1320
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,359
personality please

1321
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,680
there must be a catch i hedged

1322
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,520
there isn't said frank

1323
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,839
there be an election i said there never

1324
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,599
has been we'll just announce who the new

1325
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,280
president is

1326
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,440
and nobody will object

1327
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,680
nobody objects to anything said frank

1328
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,559
they aren't interested they don't care

1329
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,720
there has to be a catch i said

1330
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,280
there's kind of one frank admitted i

1331
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,440
knew it i began to shrink from my

1332
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,880
vendett what is it what's the catch

1333
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,040
well it isn't really a catch because you

1334
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,880
don't have to do it if you don't want to

1335
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,720
it would be a good idea though said

1336
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,680
frank

1337
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,079
let's hear this great idea

1338
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:52,960
well

1339
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,040
if you're going to be president i think

1340
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,119
you really ought to marry mona but you

1341
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,640
don't have to if you don't want to

1342
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,720
you're the boss

1343
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,040
she would have me i said

1344
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,880
if she'd have me she'd have you said

1345
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,680
frank all you have to do is ask her

1346
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,079
why should she say yes

1347
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,839
it's predicted in the books of bacon

1348
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,440
that she'll marry the next president of

1349
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,480
san lorenzo said frank

1350
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,720
so i became betrothed at dawn to the

1351
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,800
most beautiful woman in the world and i

1352
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,640
agreed to become the next president of

1353
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,800
san lorenzo

1354
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,640
papa wasn't dead yet and it was frank's

1355
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,240
feeling that i should get papa's

1356
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,359
blessing if possible so as boris cece

1357
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,599
the sun came up frank and i drove to

1358
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,839
papa's castle in a jeep we commandeered

1359
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,880
from troops guarding the next president

1360
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,520
papa manzano and his merciless disease

1361
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,680
were in a bed that was made of a golden

1362
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,640
dinghy tiller painter orlox and all all

1363
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,079
gilded

1364
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,079
bed was a lifeboat of bacon's old

1365
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,240
schooner the ladies slipper it was a

1366
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,839
lifeboat of the ship that had brought

1367
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,760
bokonen and corporal mccabe to san

1368
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,480
lorenzo so long ago the walls of the

1369
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,119
room were white but papa radiated pain

1370
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,119
so hot and bright that the wall seemed

1371
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,440
bathed in an angry red

1372
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,359
he was stripped from the waist up and

1373
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,839
his glistening belly wall was knotted

1374
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,559
his belly shivered like a luffing sail

1375
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,319
around his neck hung a chain with a

1376
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,480
cylinder the size of a rifle cartridge

1377
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,400
for a pendant i suppose that the

1378
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,960
cylinder contained some magic charm i

1379
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,520
was mistaken it contained a splinter of

1380
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,599
ice nine

1381
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,839
papa could hardly speak his teeth

1382
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,440
chattered and his breathing was beyond

1383
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,359
control

1384
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,520
papa whispered frank

1385
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,760
goodbye papa gasped his eyes were

1386
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,920
bugging sightless i brought a friend

1387
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,280
said frank

1388
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,280
goodbye said papa

1389
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,880
he's going to be the next president of

1390
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,480
san lorenzo he'll be a much better

1391
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,520
president than i could be said frank

1392
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,760
ice papa whimpered

1393
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,800
he asks for a ice said von koenigsbout

1394
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,920
when we bring it he does not want it

1395
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,760
does not matter said papa who is

1396
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,040
president of

1397
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,480
he didn't finish

1398
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,480
i finished the sentence for him san

1399
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,160
lorenzo i said san lorenzo papa agreed

1400
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,319
he managed to crooked smile

1401
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,920
good luck he croaked

1402
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,920
thank you sir i said

1403
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,640
he fell silent relaxed closed his eyes

1404
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,240
and then he whispered

1405
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,559
last rites

1406
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,720
but papa didn't die and go to heaven not

1407
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,520
then

1408
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,599
i asked frank how we might best time the

1409
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,200
announcement of my elevation to the

1410
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,440
presidency frank was no help had no

1411
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,599
ideas he left it all up to me

1412
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,280
i thought you were going to back me up i

1413
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,559
complained

1414
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,800
as far as anything technical goes said

1415
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,119
frank frank was prim about it i wasn't

1416
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,680
to violate his integrity as a technician

1417
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,359
wasn't to make him exceed the limits of

1418
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,720
his job

1419
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,240
i see i said

1420
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,000
however you want to handle the people is

1421
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,599
all right with me said frank that's your

1422
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,200
responsibility

1423
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,440
this abrupt abdication of frank from all

1424
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,680
human affairs shocked and angered me and

1425
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,160
i said to him meaning to be satirical

1426
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,920
you mind telling me what in a purely

1427
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,760
technical way is planned for this day of

1428
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,880
days

1429
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,359
i got a strictly technical reply

1430
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,359
repair the power plant and stage an air

1431
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,520
show said frank

1432
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,760
air show i asked what's that

1433
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,000
i got another wooden reply at one

1434
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,720
o'clock this afternoon sir six planes of

1435
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,880
the san lorenzo air force will fly past

1436
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,720
the palace here and shoot at targets in

1437
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,960
the water it's part of the celebration

1438
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,720
of the day of the hundred martyrs to

1439
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,440
democracy the american ambassador also

1440
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,480
plans to throw a wreath into the sea

1441
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,400
so i decided tentatively that i would

1442
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,319
have frank announce my apotheosis

1443
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:33,680
immediately following the wreath

1444
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,000
ceremony in the air show

1445
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,359
what do you think of that i said to

1446
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,160
frank you're the boss sir he said

1447
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,920
i think i'd better have a speech ready i

1448
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,599
said

1449
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,680
so i wrote my speech in a round bear

1450
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,599
room at the foot of a tower

1451
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,040
there was a table in a chair and the

1452
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,960
speech i wrote was round and bare and

1453
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,119
sparsely furnished too

1454
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,400
it was hopeful

1455
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,800
it was humble and i found it impossible

1456
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,119
not to lean on god i had never needed

1457
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,520
such support before and so had never

1458
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,160
believed that such support was available

1459
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,400
now i found that i had to believe in it

1460
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,160
and i did

1461
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,400
i pondered asking bacon to join my

1462
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,400
government thus bringing about a sort of

1463
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,640
millennium for my people and i thought

1464
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,720
of ordering that awful hook outside the

1465
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,640
palace gate to be taken down at once

1466
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,880
amidst great rejoicing but then i

1467
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,480
understood that a millennium would have

1468
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,480
to offer something more than a holy man

1469
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,319
in a position of power

1470
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:27,599
that there would have to be plenty of

1471
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,000
good things for all to eat too and nice

1472
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,559
places to live for all and good schools

1473
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,559
and good health and good times for all

1474
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,799
and worked for all who wanted it things

1475
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,960
bokonen and i were in no position to

1476
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,640
provide

1477
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,799
i was met by dr schlichter von koenig's

1478
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,799
fault who was bounding from papa's

1479
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,040
bedroom he had a wild look he took me by

1480
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,839
the arms and he cried what is it

1481
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,079
what was it he had hanging around his

1482
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,119
neck

1483
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,839
i beg your pardon i said he took it

1484
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,240
whatever was in that cylinder papa took

1485
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,640
and now he's dead

1486
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,480
i remember the cylinder papa had hung

1487
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,240
around his neck and i made an obvious

1488
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,359
guesses to its contents cyanide

1489
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,799
cyanide cyanide turns a man to cement in

1490
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,160
a second

1491
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,520
cement

1492
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,559
marble iron i have never seen such a

1493
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,440
rigid corpse before strike it anywhere

1494
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,839
and you got a note like a marimba come

1495
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:22,960
look

1496
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,880
one kenig's wild hustled me into papa's

1497
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,359
bedroom papa's head was bent back as far

1498
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,680
as it would go his weight rested on the

1499
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,359
crown of his head in the soles of his

1500
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,599
feet with the rest of his body forming a

1501
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,359
bridge whose arch thrust toward the

1502
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,079
ceiling he was shaped like an and iron

1503
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,760
and papa's lips and nostrils and

1504
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,599
eyeballs were glazed with a blue white

1505
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,640
frost

1506
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,359
such a syndrome is no novelty now god

1507
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,240
knows but it certainly was then papa

1508
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,720
manzano was the first man in history to

1509
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,280
die of ice nine

1510
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,280
i record the fact for whatever it may be

1511
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,240
worth write it all down beconan tells us

1512
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,000
he's really telling us of course how

1513
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,720
futile it is to write or read histories

1514
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,720
without accurate records of the past how

1515
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,720
can men and women be expected to avoid

1516
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,119
making serious mistakes in the future he

1517
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,280
asks ironically

1518
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,680
so again papa manzano was the first man

1519
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,960
in history to die of ice nine

1520
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,280
dr von koenig's fault the humanitarian

1521
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,040
with the terrible deficit of auschwitz

1522
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,200
and his kindliness account was the

1523
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,160
second to die of ice nine

1524
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,079
von kunig's wild went to a basin of

1525
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,640
water meaning to wash his hands when i

1526
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,799
turned to look at him he told me his

1527
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,839
hands poised over the water he was dead

1528
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,760
as hard as a statue just as you see him

1529
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,480
i brushed my fingers over his lips they

1530
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,400
looked so peculiar

1531
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,480
he put his hands into the water

1532
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,200
what chemical could possibly

1533
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,000
the question trailed off von koenigsbell

1534
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
raised his hands and the water in the

1535
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,720
basin came with them it was no longer

1536
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,760
water but a hemisphere of ice nine

1537
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,760
from kennedy's fault touched the tip of

1538
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,920
his tongue to the blue white mystery

1539
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,359
frost bloomed on his lips he froze solid

1540
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,920
tottered and crashed the blue white

1541
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,079
hemisphere shattered chunks skittered

1542
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,160
all over the floor i went to the door

1543
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,319
and bald for help soldiers and servants

1544
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,240
came running i ordered them to bring

1545
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,160
frank and newton angela to papa's room

1546
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,920
at once

1547
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,839
i let the three children of dr felix

1548
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,480
hunnicutt into papa manzano's bedroom i

1549
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,960
closed the door and i put my back to it

1550
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,599
my mood was bitter and grand i knew

1551
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,079
ice-9 for what it was i had seen it

1552
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,400
often in my dreams

1553
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,559
i could see frank dissociating himself

1554
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,720
from the causes of the mess identifying

1555
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,880
himself with growing pride and energy

1556
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,880
with the purifiers the world savers the

1557
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,000
cleaners up

1558
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,640
brooms dustpans blowtorch hot plate

1559
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,640
buckets he commanded snapping snapping

1560
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,400
snapping his fingers

1561
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,400
you propose applying a blowtorch to the

1562
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,880
bodies i asked him frank was so charged

1563
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,880
with technical thinking now that he was

1564
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,799
practically tap dancing to the music of

1565
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,640
his fingers we'll sweep up the big

1566
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,640
pieces on the floor melt them in a

1567
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,720
bucket on a hot plate he said then we'll

1568
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,400
go over every square inch of the floor

1569
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,079
with a blow torch in case there are any

1570
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,640
microscopic crystals what we'll do with

1571
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,799
the bodies and the bed

1572
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,119
he had to think some more a funeral pyre

1573
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,280
he cried really pleased with himself

1574
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,520
i'll have a great big funeral pyre built

1575
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,760
out by the hook and will have the bodies

1576
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,720
in the bed carried out and thrown in

1577
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,119
how could you give ice 9 to a man like

1578
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,839
papa manzano angela asked him

1579
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,920
let's clean up the mess first said frank

1580
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,319
and then we can talk

1581
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,920
i gathered that the republic of san

1582
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,680
lorenzo and the three hunnicures weren't

1583
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,000
the only ones who had ice 9.

1584
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,079
apparently the united states of america

1585
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:45,760
and the union of soviet socialist

1586
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,319
republics had it too the united states

1587
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,319
had obtained it through angela's husband

1588
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,079
whose plant in indianapolis was

1589
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,319
understandably surrounded by electrified

1590
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,119
fences and homicidal german shepherds

1591
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,520
and soviet russia had come by ice 9

1592
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,920
through newt's little zinca that winsome

1593
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,720
troll of ukrainian ballet

1594
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,040
i was without comment

1595
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,720
but the bodies still had to be carried

1596
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,319
to the funeral pyre

1597
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,160
we decided that this should be done with

1598
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,040
pomp

1599
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,720
that we should put it off until the

1600
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,240
ceremonies in honor of the hundred

1601
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,760
martyrs to democracy were over

1602
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,000
so i mounted the spiral staircase of my

1603
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,920
tower arrived at the uppermost

1604
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,920
battlement of my castle

1605
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,319
and looked out at my guests my servants

1606
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,400
my cliff and my lukewarm sea

1607
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,240
the hunnicures were with me we had

1608
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,839
locked papa's door and had spread the

1609
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,839
word among the household staff that papa

1610
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,000
was feeling much better

1611
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,680
soldiers were now building a funeral

1612
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,079
pyre out by the hook they did not know

1613
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,079
what the pyre was for

1614
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,720
there were many many secrets that day

1615
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,960
busy busy busy

1616
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,040
i suppose that the ceremonies might as

1617
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,640
well begin

1618
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,400
there was a hum in the air the six

1619
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,319
planes of the san lorenzo air force were

1620
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:57,200
coming

1621
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,280
skimming my lukewarm sea they were going

1622
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,520
to shoot the effigies of what h l crosby

1623
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,359
had called practically every enemy that

1624
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,680
freedom ever had

1625
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,680
we went to the seaward parapet to see

1626
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,839
the show the planes were no larger than

1627
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,160
grains of black pepper we were able to

1628
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,319
spot them because one as it happened was

1629
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,640
trailing smoke we suppose that the smoke

1630
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,640
was part of the show

1631
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,319
i saw that the planes would be coming in

1632
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,319
low below the footings of the castle and

1633
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,240
that i would miss the show

1634
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,000
i turned my head in the direction of

1635
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,240
their now snarling approach just as

1636
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,960
their guns began to hammer one plane the

1637
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,640
one that had been trailing smoke

1638
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,839
suddenly appeared belly up and in flames

1639
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,000
it dropped from my line of sight again

1640
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and crashed it once into the cliff below

1641
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,440
the castle its bombs and fuel exploded

1642
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,440
the surviving planes went booming on a

1643
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,839
racket thinning down to a mosquito hum

1644
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,440
and then there was a sound of a rock

1645
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,319
slide and one great tower of papa's

1646
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,359
castle undermined crashed down to the

1647
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,680
sea the people on the seaward parapet

1648
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,520
looked in astonishment at the empty

1649
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,760
socket where the tower had stood then i

1650
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,160
could hear rock slides of all sizes and

1651
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,040
conversations that was almost orchestral

1652
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,040
the conversation went very fast and new

1653
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,640
voices entered in

1654
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,240
they were the voices of the castle's

1655
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,920
timbers lamenting that their burdens

1656
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,480
were becoming too great

1657
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,280
the palace its massive seaward mask now

1658
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,960
gone greeted the north with a leper

1659
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,760
smile snaggletooth and bristly the

1660
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,440
bristles were the splendid ends of

1661
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,000
timbers immediately below me a large

1662
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,160
chamber had been laid open the floor of

1663
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,319
the chamber unsupported stabbed out into

1664
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,640
space like a diving platform

1665
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,400
i dreamed for a moment of dropping to

1666
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,319
the platform of springing up from it in

1667
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,280
a breathtaking swan dive folding my arms

1668
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,280
of knifing downward into a blood warm

1669
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,599
eternity with never a splash

1670
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,680
i was recalled from my dream by the cry

1671
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,680
of a darting bird above me

1672
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,440
it seemed to be asking me what had

1673
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,880
happened

1674
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,119
booty wheat had asked

1675
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,880
we all looked up at the bird and met at

1676
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,799
one another we backed away from the

1677
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,359
abyss full of dread and when i stepped

1678
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,039
off the paving stone that was supporting

1679
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,039
me the stone began to rock it was no

1680
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,280
more stable than a teeter-totter and it

1681
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,000
tottered now over the diving platform

1682
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,920
down it crashed onto the platform made

1683
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,319
the platform a shoot and down the chute

1684
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,240
came the furnishings still remaining in

1685
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,520
the room below

1686
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,760
a xylophone shot out first scampering

1687
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,079
fast on its tiny wheels out came a

1688
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,160
bedside table in a crazy race with a

1689
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,799
bounding blow torch out came chairs in

1690
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,280
hot pursuit and somewhere in that room

1691
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,400
below out of sight something mightily

1692
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,640
reluctant to move was beginning to move

1693
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,880
down the chute it crept

1694
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,760
at last it showed its golden bow

1695
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,000
it was the boat in which dead papa

1696
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,480
monzano lay

1697
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,400
it reached the end of the shoot

1698
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,520
its bow nodded down it tipped

1699
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,480
down it fell end over end

1700
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,319
papa was thrown clear and he fell

1701
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,720
separately i closed my eyes

1702
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,559
there was a sound like that of the

1703
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,039
gentle closing of a portal as big as the

1704
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,079
sky

1705
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,240
the great door of heaven being closed

1706
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,480
softly it was a grand

1707
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,440
i opened my eyes and all the sea was ice

1708
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,839
nine

1709
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,079
do what we must muddily must muddle he

1710
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,960
must muddle he must muddle he do muddle

1711
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,880
there were no smells there was no

1712
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,119
movement every step i took made a

1713
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,400
gravelly squeak in blue white frost and

1714
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,039
every squeak was echoed loudly

1715
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:50,079
the season of locking was over

1716
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,240
the earth was locked up tight

1717
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,839
it was winter

1718
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,880
now and forever

1719
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,039
and i remembered the fourteenth book of

1720
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,200
bocconan which i had read in its

1721
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,760
entirety the night before the fourteenth

1722
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,280
book is entitled

1723
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,200
what can a thoughtful man hope for

1724
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,039
mankind on earth

1725
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,119
given the experience of the past million

1726
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,039
years

1727
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,280
it doesn't take long to read the 14th

1728
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,400
book

1729
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,119
it consists of one word

1730
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,799
and a period

1731
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:23,039
this is the word

1732
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,039
nothing
