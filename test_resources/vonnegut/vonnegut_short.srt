1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,620
Call me Jonah. My parents did or nearly did. They called me John.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,920
Jonah, John, if I'd been a Sam, I would have been a Jonah still.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,060
Not because I've been unlucky for others, but because somebody or something has compelled me to be certain places at certain times without fail.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,040
Conveyances and motives both conventional and bizarre have been provided.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,600
And according to plan, at each appointed second, at each appointed place, this Jonah was there.

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:39,740
Listen, when I was a younger man, two wives ago, 250,000 cigarettes ago, 3,000 quarts of booze ago,

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,120
When I was a much younger man, I began to collect material for a book to be called The Day the World Ended.

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,720
The book was to be factual.

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:58,480
The book was to be an account of what important Americans had done on the day when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.

10
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,320
It was to be a Christian book. I was a Christian then.

11
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,940
I am a Bacconinist now.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,160
I would have been a Bacconinist then, if there had been anyone to teach me the bittersweet lies of Bacconin.

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:23,640
But Bacconinism was unknown beyond the gravel beaches and coral knives that ring this little island in the Caribbean Sea, the Republic of San Lorenzo.

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:33,820
We Bacconinists believe that humanity is organized into teams, teams that do God's will without ever discovering what they are doing.

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:43,940
Such a team is called a caress by Bacconin, and the instrument, the can-can, that brought me into my own particular caress was the book I never finished.

16
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,860
The book to be called The Day the World Ended.

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:02,960
If you find your life tangled up with somebody else's life for no very logical reasons, writes Bacconin, that person may be a member of your caress.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
At another point in the books of Bacconin, he tells us,

19
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,180
Man created the checkerboard. God created the caress.

20
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:19,340
By that he means that a caress ignores national, institutional, occupational, familial, and class boundaries.

21
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,580
It is as free form as an amoeba.

22
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,580
In his 53rd Calypso, Bacconin invites us to sing along with him.

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,680
Oh, a sleeping drunkard up in Central Park, and a lion hunter in the jungle dark,

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,660
And a Chinese dentist and a British queen, all fit together in the same machine.

25
00:02:49,460 --> 00:03:00,720
Nice, nice, very nice, nice, nice, very nice, nice, nice, very nice.

26
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,380
Many different people in the same device.

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,920
About my caress, then, it surely includes the three children of Dr. Felix Hunniker,

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,080
One of the so-called fathers of the first atomic bomb.

29
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,000
Dr. Hunniker himself was no doubt a member of my caress.

30
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,640
Though he was dead before my sanukas, the tendrils of my life, began to tangle with those of his children.

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,280
The first of his heirs to be touched by my sanukas was Newton Hunniker, the youngest of his three children.

32
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,300
The younger of his two sons.

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,160
I wrote this letter to Newt.

34
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,580
Dear Mr. Hunniker,

35
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,880
I am gathering material for a book relating to the first atomic bomb.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,040
Since your late father is generally recognized as having been one of the chief...

37
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,100
That you learn how to read.
